## Introduction

A DS5230 final project applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to build and train models that can be used to predict muscle gestures given electromyography (EMG) data collected by 8 sensors placed on skin surface.

We will use data set https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyr7plus/emg-4 in this project. Potential Unsupervised Machine Learning applications include Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Anomaly Detection, etc.

This project have the potential to make a significant difference in the lives of people who use prosthetic limbs. By mapping muscle movements to prosthetic actions, users can control their artificial limbs more naturally and effectively, improving their quality of life. It can also help individuals recovering from injuries or surgeries to regain muscle functions.

Beyond prosthetics, this technology can also be applied to develop sophisticated human-machine interfaces. It can be integrated with VR or gaming devices where users could control game characters or navigate virtual environments using natural muscle movements.

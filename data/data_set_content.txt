Four classes of motion were written from MYO armband with the help of our app https://github.com/cyber-punk-me/nukleos.
The MYO armband has 8 sensors placed on skin surface, each measures electrical activity produced by muscles beneath.

Each dataset line has 8 consecutive readings of all 8 sensors. so 64 columns of EMG data. The last column is a resulting gesture that was made while recording the data (classes 0-3)
So each line has the following structure:

[8sensors][8sensors][8sensors][8sensors][8sensors][8sensors][8sensors][8sensors][GESTURE_CLASS]
Data was recorded at 200 Hz, which means that each line is 8*(1/200) seconds = 40ms of record time.

A classifier given 64 numbers would predict a gesture class (0-3).
Gesture classes were : rock - 0, scissors - 1, paper - 2, ok - 3. Rock, paper, scissors gestures are like in the game with the same name, and OK sign is index finger touching the thumb and the rest of the fingers spread. Gestures were selected pretty much randomly.

Each gesture was recorded 6 times for 20 seconds. Each time recording started with the gesture being already prepared and held. Recording stopped while the gesture was still being held. In total there is 120 seconds of each gesture being held in fixed position. All of them recorded from the same right forearm in a short timespan. Every recording of a certain gesture class was concatenated into a .csv file with a corresponding name (0-3).
